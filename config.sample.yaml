# Copy this file to config.yaml and fill in your details.
# Minimum you need: club_id + either league_id OR match_ids.
# Option A (recommended): set league_id to auto-discover matches from the league pages.
# Option B: provide match_ids explicitly.

# Base path for your CricClubs league (no trailing slash).
# Example: https://cricclubs.com/HoustonPremierT20League
base_path: "https://cricclubs.com/YOUR_LEAGUE_PATH"

# Numeric Club ID (find it in URLs as &clubId=XXXX)
club_id: 1366

# Optional: Numeric League ID (find it in URL as league=NN).
# If provided, exporter will try to discover matches from league "Schedule" & "Results".
league_id: 25

# Your team name as shown on match titles/scorecards (used for team-level metrics)
team_name: "Royals"

# Optional: If you don't want auto-discovery, list match IDs explicitly.
# Example: [1861, 1843, 1841, 1796, 1783, 1777]
match_ids: []


# --- Advanced: multiple tournaments ---
# Instead of a single league_id, you can list multiple entries. The exporter can loop each
# and save outputs in subfolders. (If you only use analyze.py, simply drop all CSVs in any
# subfolders of cricclubs_export_out/ and they'll be merged automatically.)
# leagues:
#   - { base_path: "https://cricclubs.com/YourLeagueA", club_id: 1111, league_id: 2222 }
#   - { base_path: "https://cricclubs.com/YourLeagueB", club_id: 3333, league_id: 4444 }
#
# Optional: player photos mapping (CSV file path, columns: name,photo_url)
# players_csv: "players.csv"
