---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Finding Your Team IDs

1. Open your team's CricClubs URL:
   ```
   https://cricclubs.com/HoustonPremierT20League/teamResults.do?teamId=598&league=25&clubId=1366
   ```

2. Extract from URL:
   - `teamId=598` → `team_id: 598`
   - `league=25` → `league_id: 25`
   - `clubId=1366` → `club_id: 1366`

### Example `config.yaml`

```yaml
team_name: "Royals"

leagues:
  - base_path: "https://cricclubs.com/HoustonPremierT20League"
    club_id: 1366
    league_id: 25
    team_id: 598

  # Add more tournaments to combine data
  - base_path: "https://cricclubs.com/HoustonUnitedPremierLeague"
    club_id: 1366
    league_id: 32
    team_id: 712
```

### Optional Settings

**Player Photos:**
```yaml
players_csv: "players.csv"  # CSV with name,photo_url columns
```

**Specific Matches Only:**
```yaml
leagues:
  - base_path: "..."
    match_ids: [1861, 1843, 1841]  # Skip discovery, fetch only these
```

**Customize Team Logo:**
- Replace `team_dashboard/assets/Royals_Logo.png` with your logo
- Or add logo path in config (if supported)

## ⚡️ Data Export Features

The `cricclubs_export.py` script includes several performance and efficiency features:

### Incremental Updates (Default)

**By default, StatCastle only fetches new matches** - it's smart about not re-downloading data you already have:

- ✅ **First run**: Discovers and fetches all matches for your team
- ✅ **Subsequent runs**: Only fetches new matches that weren't in previous runs
- ✅ **Automatic detection**: Compares discovered match IDs with existing `matches.json` files
- ✅ **Efficient**: Saves time and bandwidth by skipping already-fetched matches

**Example:**
```bash
# First run - fetches all 50 matches
python3 cricclubs_export.py
# Output: "saved 50 matches (50 new, 0 existing)"

# Second run (after 5 new matches played) - only fetches 5 new matches
python3 cricclubs_export.py
# Output: "saved 55 matches (5 new, 50 existing)"
```

### Force Refresh

To re-fetch all matches (useful if data was corrupted or you want fresh data):

```bash
# Docker
FORCE_REFRESH=1 docker-compose up

# Local
FORCE_REFRESH=1 python3 cricclubs_export.py
```

**When to use:**
- Data corruption or incomplete fetches
- Want to refresh all match data
- Testing or debugging

### Multi-Threading for Performance

StatCastle uses parallel processing to speed up data fetching:

**Two-Level Parallelism:**
1. **League-level**: Multiple leagues processed simultaneously
2. **Match-level**: Multiple matches per league fetched in parallel

**Performance Tuning:**

```bash
# Increase parallel workers for faster fetching (if you have good internet)
MAX_LEAGUE_WORKERS=5 MAX_MATCH_WORKERS=8 python3 cricclubs_export.py

# Reduce workers if you're getting rate-limited
MAX_LEAGUE_WORKERS=1 MAX_MATCH_WORKERS=2 python3 cricclubs_export.py
```

**Environment Variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MAX_LEAGUE_WORKERS` | `3` | Number of leagues to process in parallel |
| `MAX_MATCH_WORKERS` | `4` | Number of matches per league to fetch in parallel |
| `MATCH_DELAY` | `0.3` | Delay between match requests (seconds) - prevents rate limiting |
| `FORCE_REFRESH` | `0` | Set to `1` to re-fetch all matches (ignores incremental mode) |

**Performance Tips:**
- **Fast internet + stable connection**: Increase `MAX_MATCH_WORKERS` to 6-8
- **Slow/unstable connection**: Reduce to 2-3 workers, increase `MATCH_DELAY` to 0.5-1.0
- **Rate limiting issues**: Increase `MATCH_DELAY` to 0.5-1.0 seconds
- **Multiple leagues**: `MAX_LEAGUE_WORKERS=3` is usually optimal

**Example with custom settings:**
```bash
# Aggressive fetching (fast connection, many matches)
MAX_LEAGUE_WORKERS=5 MAX_MATCH_WORKERS=8 MATCH_DELAY=0.2 python3 cricclubs_export.py

# Conservative fetching (slow connection, avoid rate limits)
MAX_LEAGUE_WORKERS=2 MAX_MATCH_WORKERS=2 MATCH_DELAY=0.8 python3 cricclubs_export.py
```

## 🌐 GitHub Pages Deployment

StatCastle automatically deploys your dashboard to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

### Setup (One-Time)

1. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to repository **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: **GitHub Actions**

2. **Push to main branch:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update dashboard"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Access your dashboard:**
   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/statcastle/team_dashboard/
   ```

### Auto-Deployment

The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` workflow:
- ✅ Runs on every push to `main`
- ✅ Builds dashboard and PDF
- ✅ Deploys to GitHub Pages automatically
- ✅ Scheduled runs (every Monday at 12:00 UTC)

**Note:** The workflow uses Python directly (not Docker) for GitHub Actions compatibility.

## 🧩 Advanced Usage

### Multi-Tournament Analysis

Combine data from multiple seasons:

```yaml
leagues:
  - base_path: "https://cricclubs.com/League2023"
    club_id: 1366
    league_id: 25
    team_id: 598
  - base_path: "https://cricclubs.com/League2024"
    club_id: 1366
    league_id: 32
    team_id: 598  # Same team, different season
```

### Scheduled Updates

**Using Docker:**
```bash
# Add to crontab for weekly updates
0 2 * * 1 cd /path/to/statcastle && docker-compose up
```

**Using Kubernetes:**
See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for CronJob examples.

### Custom Player Photos

1. Create `players.csv`:
   ```csv
   Name,PhotoURL
   John Smith,https://cricclubs.com/.../profilePic.jpg
   ```

2. Add to `config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   players_csv: "players.csv"
   ```
